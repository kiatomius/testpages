## Motivation

There is an increasing prevalence of tweets generated by automated twitter accounts or 'bots', amidst the backdrop of the exponential growth of twitter usage which we have been seeing in recent years. The intensions behind the creation of these tweets varies, from non-malicious ones, such as government agencies ‘automatically’ generating tweets on adverse weather events to promptly alert the public, to malicious ones – seeking to manipulate the twitter community for commercial or political purposes. A simple ‘bot’ may be designed to follow a political figure in order to increase the figure’s follower counts. A more complicated ‘bot’ may send out automated tweets that resemble human behaviour, with the intention of influencing the public discourse. The official Twitter platform has done much work in detecting these automated ‘bots’ with malicious intents, seeking to block them from the platform. However, growing sophistication of the automated bots is making the process of detection increasingly difficult for the Twitter as well as the research community. Social Media, including twitter, has never been more important in our political dialogue, and we believe that the attempts to detect malicious bots would be a meaningful exercise, regardless of one's political affiliation.

Here is some inline math $\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$ and, of-course, E rules:

$$ G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu}  = 8 \pi T_{\mu\nu} . $$
